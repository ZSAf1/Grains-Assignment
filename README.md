# Grains-Assignment and Two Fer Assignment
Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard.  A chessboard has 64 squares. Square 1 has one grain, square 2 has two grains, square 3 has four grains, and so on, doubling each time.  Write code that calculates:  - the number of grains on a given square - the total number of grains on the chessboard

Imagine a bakery that has a holiday offer where you can buy two cookies for the price of one ("two-fer one!"). You take the offer and (very generously) decide to give the extra cookie to someone else in the queue.
